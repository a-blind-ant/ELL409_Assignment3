Support Vector Regression

I. Implementations:
	
	1. SVR from scratch using CVXOPT library for optimization
	
	2. SVR using sklearn library  

II. DataSet:	Boston Housing DataSet (http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston)



Hence performed Support Vector Regression (SVR) on the given dataset using a general-purpose
convex optimization package (CVXOPT) as well as using a customized solver (sklearn). 
Predicting MEDV using the given 13 features.
